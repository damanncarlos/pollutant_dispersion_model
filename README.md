# pollutant_dispersion_model
Here's an atmospheric dispersion model for pollutants according to he gaussian dispersion model

There are many different models for atmospheric dispersion of pollutants, the gaussian model is one of the most used and since it was created 
many scholars have updated the equations and ways to apply the model, I've done some research and picked out of the many options the formulas that I've most liked 
based on the variables that they use and some that I saw in college (pretty arbitrary actually). 

This is the my first code, so I know that many things can be done better, and I'll keep updating it. 
It's written in spanish, next time will be in english. 
I'll leave the papers and books from where I've gotten the formulas.
